// Instagram rejects images whose aspect ratio is outside its accepted range
// (portrait 4:5 = 0.8 through landscape 1.91:1) with the Graph API error
// "The aspect ratio is not supported.". Our question cards render at a VARIABLE
// height, so an unusually TALL card can drop below the 0.8 minimum. Facebook
// accepts any ratio, which is why the same post can succeed on Facebook yet
// fail on Instagram.
//
// IMPORTANT: most cards already sit inside the accepted range, so they must be
// posted EXACTLY as-is — identical to the quiz card, with no letterbox bars.
// Only the rare out-of-range card needs adjusting. We therefore use Cloudinary
// CONDITIONAL transformations: pad ONLY when the card is too tall (or, very
// rarely, too wide), and leave every in-range card completely untouched.
// Padding never crops — the whole card stays visible — and because the card has
// a white background the minimal bars blend in.

// Instagram's accepted aspect-ratio bounds (width / height).

// Instagram's Content Publishing API only reliably accepts JPEG images — a PNG
// would be rejected with "Only photo or video can be accepted as media type.".
// We force JPEG delivery with `f_jpg` (also a safety net for custom PNG media a
// schedule can carry).
//
// CRITICAL: the JPEG must be BASELINE, not PROGRESSIVE. Cloudinary's default
// lossy JPEG encoder (`fl_lossy` / `q_auto`) emits a PROGRESSIVE JPEG, and
// Instagram's media ingest CANNOT decode a progressive JPEG — it rejects the
// URL with subcode 2207052 "The media could not be fetched from this URI /
// Only photo or video can be accepted as media type." even though the URL is
// public, small, in-range and returns HTTP 200 (verified: `file` reported the
// delivered image as "progressive", and Meta's crawler could fetch it fine but
// still rejected it). `fl_progressive:none` forces a BASELINE JPEG, which Meta
// accepts. Facebook is more lenient and accepted the progressive image, which
// is why the SAME post showed `Facebook ✓ · Instagram ✗`.
//
// `q_auto:good` keeps the baseline JPEG a sensible size (~175 KB for a 1440 px
// card), and `c_limit,w_1440` caps the delivered width so a 2×-density render
// (flashcard ~3200×2048, question card ~2080×2800) doesn't trigger subcode
// 2207076 ("Media upload has failed"). `c_limit` never upscales, only
// downscales in proportion, so smaller cards deliver unchanged.

// Cloudinary conditional transform (runs AFTER the format component):
//   if the image is TALLER than 4:5  -> pad (add side bars) up to 4:5
//   else if it is WIDER than 1.91:1  -> pad (add top/bottom bars) down to 1.91
//   otherwise                        -> NO padding, deliver the exact card
// Each `if_…` block is closed by `if_end`; the two conditions are mutually
// exclusive, so at most one pad is ever applied. `b_white` fills the (minimal)
// padding to match the card background.
//
// SYNTAX: the `if_<condition>` MUST be its OWN URL component (separated by `/`)
// — NOT comma-joined with the transform it guards. Writing
// `if_ar_lt_0.8,c_pad,…` makes Cloudinary return HTTP 400 (an error page, not
// an image), and Instagram then fails to fetch it with the misleading error
// "Only photo or video can be accepted as media type." (subcode 2207052 =

// which CROPS whatever doesn't fit — so a wide card loses its left/right edges
// and the text is chopped off (the bug reported from the live IG Story).
//
// Fix: pre-pad the card onto an exact 9:16 canvas ourselves with Cloudinary
// `c_pad` (CONTAIN — scale to fit, then add white bars). The delivered image is
// already 9:16, so the platform has nothing to crop and the WHOLE card stays
